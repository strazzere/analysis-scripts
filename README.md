# analysis-scripts
A random assortment of analysis scripts

## What?
Mainly these are just going to be scripts I have created and
used during the analysis of malware. Most are to automate simple
tasks and collect data. The main reason for a new repository
(opposed to the android-scripts) is because most of these are
non-Android specific and being used in a more generalized fashion.
